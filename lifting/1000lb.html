      The 1000-pound club is a achievement that takes most lifters multiple years of training to reach.  It requires the lifters one rep max bench press, squat, and deadlift to total 1000 or more pounds.  For most people this breaks down as around 225 Bench, 330 Squat, and 445 Deadlift, although it is different for each person.  For women the equivalent is 600 pounds, where the break down will likely be closer to 120 Bench, 205 Squat, 275 Deadlift.

      At our gym, you will receive prizes for hitting either of these milestones.  If you donâ€™t want to attempt a one-rep max, you can instead do a five-rep max for a total of 900 for men or 540 for women.  Note this will almost certainly be more challenging than the one-rep milestone.  Also, all three lifts should occur in our gym.  Normal rules for the lift apply as well of course; squats need to be at least parallel; bar needs to touch your chest for bench etc.  Happy lifting!
