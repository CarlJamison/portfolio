        There are only two supplements that are particularly effective in building muscle and strength: protein powder and creatine.
        <br><br>
        Most men trying to get bigger and stronger should have at least 150 grams of protein per day, while women should have at least 120 grams.  
        For most people, this may just mean adding a protein heavy snack most days as a 4th meal.  A convenient snack could just be protein power and water or milk.  Each serving of our shake has about 30 grams of whey protein isolate added.  Whey is a very high-quality source, while isolate means it’s at least 90% protein.  
        
        Here's a few brands of whey protein I’ve tried and recommend.  
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sports-Whey-Protein-Isolate-10-Pound/dp/B000MAK59O/ref=asc_df_B000MAK59O/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=692875362841&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6329190720948586831&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9019484&hvtargid=pla-2281435185258&psc=1&mcid=5564cacfe0553879b35f8f87228ac934&hvocijid=6329190720948586831-B000MAK59O-&hvexpln=73">Now Nutrition (This is what we use on Mondays) (Cheapest)</a></li>

        </ul>

        <br>
        
        Creatine is a compound that already our bodies use and store for energy.  It’s one of the most researched supplements, and there are little to no confirmed negative side effects, while having many noticeable benefits for most people, including faster muscle and strength gains, and some mental health improvements.  Take 5 grams daily. Anything more, or a loading phase as is sometimes recommended, is unnecessary.  Most people will gain a few pounds within the first few weeks of taking it, this is lean body mass and nothing to worry about.  
        Here's a few brands I’ve tried and recommend.

        <ul>

            <li><a href="https://www.costco.com/optimum-nutrition%2c-micronized-creatine-powder%2c-unflavored%2c-1.49-lbs.product.4000325750.html">Optimum Nutrition (This is what we use on Mondays)</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        For both of these supplements, it’s totally fine to just grab whatever brand you see at target or Walmart, it will just likely be much more expensive.  I’ve done a lot of research finding good prices for decent brands.
