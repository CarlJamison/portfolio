      How much food you eat is immensely important to building muscle or losing fat.  While it’s possible to do both at the same time, it will likely be more effective to drop to whatever body fat you want if needed, and then work to build muscle from there.  This is the sequence of cutting and bulking.  If you exercise while eating less calories than you burn (a calorie deficit) you will likely not lose muscle, but you probably won’t gain any.  For most men, this will mean eating around 2000 calories a day, although it will very a lot from person to person.  2000 should just be a starting point, if after a couple weeks you’re losing more than a few pounds a week and you feel like you’re starving yourself, you should probably eat more.  If your weight is unchanged, or going up, cut the calories further.  Once you’ve reached your desired weight, you should start to bulk, aiming to gain at least a pound a month.  Muscle building weight gain is generally slower than losing weight.  For most men, this will mean eating around 3000 calories a day, but again this will vary.  For both bulking and cutting, aim to eat at least 150 to 200 grams of protein per day.

      Here are a few high protein cheap snack ideas to help get your calorie and protein intake for the day.
      <br><br>
      <b>Eggs (4):</b> (24g protein, 320 calories) I often have this for breakfast.  Back in my day this was like 30 cents, but it’s still fairly cheap. $1.30
      <br><br>
      <b>Greek Non-fat Yogurt (1 Cup):</b> (24g protein, 135 calories) This is a nice option, both because it’s low calorie on its own if you want that, but also because you can mix anything you want into it: fruit, honey, protein powder, creatine etc. $1.00
      <br><br>
      <b>Kwik Trip Chicken Tenders (2):</b> (50g protein, 450 calories) Kwik Trip has a 2 for $8 deal, which can be split into three meals and easily microwaved.  $2.75
      <br><br>
      <b>PB&J Sandwich (2):</b> (30g protein, 850 calories) Peanut Butter is a surprisingly high source of both protein and calories. 
      <br><br>
      <b>Milk and Unflavored Protein Powder (2 Cups and a scoop):</b> (40g protein, 400 calories) Easy to make and easy to get down. 
      <br><br>
      <b>Tuna (1 can):</b> (36g protein, 180 calories) protein and calories depend on the brand, but this is another low calorie, easy to make option.  Add cheese, spices, and mayo to keep it interesting.
